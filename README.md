Cifar-10 Image Classifiction
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
Given an image we need to predict the correct class of this image?
The images are very small (32x32) and by visualizing them you will notice how difficult it is to distinguish them even for a human.
In this notebook we are going to build a CNN model that can classify images of various objects. We have 10 class of images:

1.Airplane
2.Automobile
3.Bird
4.Cat
5.Deer
6.Dog
7.Frog
8.Horse
9.Ship
10.Truck

We have 10 classes, so if we pick a image and we randomly gues it class, we have 1/10 probability to be true.
